# Given a 2D array m x n representing a whole fish. At each cell, a '*' represent part of the fish
# while the '.' represent the empty cutboard space. Determine a vertical point (floating point) that

# Difficulty: 2

# Example:
fish = """
    ....#..
    ..###.#.
    .######.
    ...##...
    ........
""".strip().split()
